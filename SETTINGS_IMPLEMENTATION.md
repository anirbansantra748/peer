# Settings Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added complete API key management and subscription functionality to the Peer Code Review system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Routes (services/ui/app.js)

#### API Keys Management
- **GET /settings/api-keys** - Display API keys management page
- **POST /settings/api-keys/:provider** - Add/update encrypted API keys for Groq and Gemini
- **DELETE /settings/api-keys/:provider** - Remove stored API keys

#### Subscription Management
- **GET /settings/subscription** - Display subscription plans page
- **POST /settings/subscription/checkout** - Upgrade subscription (dummy payment flow)
- **POST /settings/subscription/downgrade** - Downgrade to free tier

### 2. Frontend Views

#### API Keys Page (views/api-keys.ejs)
- Beautiful GitHub-style dark theme UI
- Support for Groq and Gemini API keys
- Visual status indicators (Added/Not Added badges)
- Encrypted storage with security notice
- Direct links to provider API key generation pages
- Warning when token limit is reached

#### Subscription Page (views/subscription.ejs)
- Three-tier pricing: Free, Pro, Enterprise
- **Free Plan**: 1,000 tokens/month
- **Pro Plan**: 100,000 tokens/month ($29/mo)
- **Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited tokens ($99/mo)
- Visual current plan indicator
- FAQ section
- Dummy checkout flow (instant upgrade)

#### Dashboard Integration (views/index.ejs)
- Settings dropdown in header with ⚙️ icon

- Hover-activated dropdown menu

### 3. Security Features

#### Encryption
- API keys encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption utility: `shared/utils/encryption.js`
- Encryption key: `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from .env file
- Keys never exposed in plain text in UI

#### User Data Model
The User model already includes:
- `apiKeys.groq` - Encrypted Groq API key
- `apiKeys.gemini` - Encrypted Gemini API key
- `subscriptionTier` - free/pro/enterprise
- `tokenLimit` - Usage limit based on tier
- `tokensUsed` - Current usage tracking
- `subscriptionExpiry` - Expiration date
- `subscriptionStatus` - active/expired/cancelled

### 4. Token Limits by Tier

| Tier | Token Limit | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Free | 1,000 | $0 |
| Pro | 100,000 | $29/mo |
| Enterprise | Unlimited (-1) | $99/mo |

### 5. User Experience Features

#### API Keys Page
- Shows whether each provider key is configured
- Allows users to add their own keys to bypass token limits
- Links to get free API keys from providers
- One-click removal with confirmation
- Success/error messages via query params

#### Subscription Page
- Visual comparison of all plans
- Current plan highlighted with badge
- "Most Popular" banner on Pro plan
- Instant upgrade (no real payment processing)
- Token usage reset on upgrade
- 30-day subscription period set automatically

#### Navigation
- Settings dropdown accessible from dashboard header
- Quick action links in dashboard
- Breadcrumb navigation on settings pages

## Testing Checklist

### API Keys
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → API Keys
- [ ] Add a Groq API key
- [ ] Verify encrypted storage in database
- [ ] Add a Gemini API key
- [ ] Remove a key and verify deletion
- [ ] Check error handling for empty keys

### Subscriptions
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Subscription
- [ ] View all three plans
- [ ] Upgrade to Pro plan
- [ ] Verify token limit increased to 100,000
- [ ] Verify tokensUsed reset to 0
- [ ] Upgrade to Enterprise
- [ ] Verify unlimited tokens (limit = -1)
- [ ] Downgrade to Free
- [ ] Verify limit capped to 1,000

### Multi-Tenancy
- [ ] Each user sees only their own API keys
- [ ] Subscription changes only affect current user
- [ ] Token usage tracked per user
- [ ] No data leakage between users

## Environment Variables Required

```env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=9o52LGnP0bYCeSzxywfhBE4a7sIvXHZQ
```

Already configured in your `.env` file ✓

## Database Schema

User model fields used:
```javascript
{
  apiKeys: {
    groq: String,      // Encrypted
    gemini: String     // Encrypted
  },
  subscriptionTier: String,           // 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'
  subscriptionStatus: String,         // 'active' | 'expired' | 'cancelled'
  subscriptionExpiry: Date,
  tokenLimit: Number,                 // -1 for unlimited
  tokensUsed: Number
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Real Payment Integration**
   - Integrate Stripe or similar payment processor
   - Add webhook handlers for payment events
   - Implement subscription renewal logic

2. **Token Usage Analytics**
   - Per-user usage dashboard
   - Usage history chart
   - Provider breakdown (Groq vs Gemini)

3. **API Key Validation**
   - Test API keys before saving
   - Show connection status
   - Auto-detect invalid keys

4. **Subscription Features**
   - Email notifications for expiring subscriptions
   - Automatic downgrades on expiry
   - Prorated upgrades/downgrades
   - Invoice generation

5. **UI Enhancements**
   - Usage progress bars
   - Remaining tokens indicator
   - Cost estimator for plans

## Files Modified

1. `services/ui/app.js` - Added 7 new routes
2. `services/ui/views/index.ejs` - Added settings navigation
3. `services/ui/views/api-keys.ejs` - Already existed ✓
4. `services/ui/views/subscription.ejs` - Already existed ✓

## Dependencies

All dependencies already installed:
- `crypto` (Node.js built-in) - For encryption
- `mongoose` - User model storage
- Express middleware already configured

## How to Use

### For End Users

1. **Adding API Keys**
   - Click Settings → API Keys
   - Enter your Groq or Gemini API key
   - Keys are encrypted and stored securely
   - Use your own credits instead of platform credits

2. **Managing Subscription**
   - Click Settings → Subscription
   - Choose a plan and click upgrade
   - Instant activation (dummy payment)
   - Token limits automatically updated

### For Developers

The system automatically:
- Checks user token limits before AI operations
- Falls back to user's API keys if platform limit reached
- Tracks token usage per request
- Updates subscription status

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. API keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
2. Encryption key stored in `.env` - DO NOT commit to git
3. Keys never logged or exposed in responses
4. HTTPS required in production
5. Subscription changes logged with user ID

## Support

If users encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ENCRYPTION_KEY is set
3. Check MongoDB connection
4. Review server logs for detailed errors

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete and Ready for Testing
