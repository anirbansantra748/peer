### 3. **Backend Routes**
- `GET /installations` - List all active installations
- `GET /installations/:id/settings` - View settings form
- `POST /installations/:id/settings` - Save configuration changes

### 4. **Integration with PR Workflow**
- PR webhook handler checks installation before processing
- Returns 403 if app not installed on repository
- Applies installation config during analysis:
  - Filters findings by configured severity levels
  - Stores installationId reference in PRRun
- Analyzer worker uses installation config:
  - Loads config at job start
  - Filters findings before saving to database
